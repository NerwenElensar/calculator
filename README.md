# Calculator ðŸ§®

This is a calculator that can do basic calculators. It can take in two numbers and an operator, by pressing equals it calculates the result. Further on it is possible to chain calculations, by adding an additional operator. This will show the previous calculation result in the display and you can continue on with that result. 

It also shows a little error message when dividing by zero. 
Calculations with bigger numbers are not accurate as the display size is limited to 9 digits.
It will show decimals, but it is not possible to use them in a calculation.
